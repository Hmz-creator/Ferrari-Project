# The Ferrari-Project





This is my first project on Git-Hub and in general. I started learning HTML and CSS back in May and decided to test my skills with a project centered around my interests, which in this case is the Scuderia Ferrari Formula-1 team. I was always intrigued by their website so i decided to test myself and re-create it with the best of my abilities. I am currently new to coding in general so feel free to eradicate mistakes you spot in my code, your valuable feedback will help me learn and progress as a developer. 

The project features three separate sections. The first being the navigation bar and the slide-show with images of the team. The second being the general information about the team including their drivers, team principal and other staff and lastly to conclude their sponsors. The project has some links embedded which lead to the actual Ferrari site to make it a bit interactive.
