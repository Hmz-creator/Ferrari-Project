# Ferrari-Project
This is my first project on Git-Hub and in general. I started learning HTML and CSS back in May and decided to test my skills with a project centered around my interests, which in this case is the Scuderia Ferrari Formula-1 team. I was always intrigued by their website so i decided to test myself and re-create it with the ebst of my abilities.
